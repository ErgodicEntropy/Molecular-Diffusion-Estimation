# MolecularDynamicsDiffCoeff
Molecular dynamics simulation is a numerical simulation used to study the behavior of molecular systems at the atomic scale. In this project, the goal is to simulate the molecular dynamics of ACN-[BMI][BF4] electrolyte and examine how the diffusion coefficients, energy and volume change in a considered temperature interval. (300K-1200K))
